## Hi, I'm Riley Feeney 👋

Hi, I'm Riley Feeney 👋

I’ve always loved exploring what happens behind the scenes to make systems work, which led me to dive into software engineering. I enjoy building **reliable backend systems**, designing **APIs**, and implementing **automated testing** to ensure software works as intended.

I have hands-on experience in **Go, Python, TypeScript, Java, and C#**, and I have built **Postman automated tests** (over 276 tests for my website portfolio backend project) as well as **JUnit 5 test suites** for Java applications. My projects showcase backend development, data validation, and QA best practices.

I’m actively seeking a role as a **Software Engineer or QA Engineer**, where I can contribute to high-quality software while continuing to learn and grow on a team of experienced engineers.

Feel free to browse my [repositories](https://github.com/rjfeeney) to see my projects, automated testing work, and examples of backend systems I’ve built.

### A few non-coding things about me:
- I have a BA in Communications and an MS in Business and Analytics.
- I sing and play bass guitar. If you're curious, feel free to check out the two original bands I currently play with: [Hyperfix](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5KYfM00ujFHk9wd19Stoyw?si=EsFI2R1bSR-V5mm5AcL0qg) and [Layzi](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Osd22FCebAqWNl7q2sazx?si=Hzm7dCUkT6u5cJ8dwCxgfA)
- I co-founded a Wedding Band/Entertainment Agency with one of my closest friends. Together we perform at hundreds of weddings and events every year.
